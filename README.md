# Clinedi

Clinedi is a portable Common Lisp line editor for terminal applications. It
separates a Unicode-aware incremental editor from its blocking terminal
frontend, so applications can either feed it semantic events or use it as a
complete interactive input loop.

The editor handles extended grapheme clusters, terminal-cell layout, wrapped
multiline input, history navigation, bracketed paste, completion presentation,
syntax-highlighting callbacks and ghost-text suggestions. Shell parsing,
completion policy and history persistence remain the application's concern.

## Loading

Clinedi is an ASDF system and has no third-party dependencies.

```lisp
(ql:quickload :clinedi)
```

For local Quicklisp development, either place the checkout directly below
`~/quicklisp/local-projects/`, or add its parent directory before registering
local projects:

```lisp
(pushnew #P"/root/common-lisp/"
         ql:*local-project-directories*
         :test #'equal)
(ql:register-local-projects)
```

Quicklisp does not reliably discover a project through a directory symlink in
`local-projects`.

## Incremental editor

```lisp
(let ((editor (clinedi:make-line-editor :history '("git status"))))
  (clinedi:line-editor-handle-event editor '(:insert "echo 猫"))
  (clinedi:line-editor-handle-event editor :left)
  (clinedi:line-editor-text editor))
```

`line-editor-handle-event` accepts semantic editing events and returns an
action plus an optional payload. This API is suitable for event-driven terminal
UIs that own their repaint loop. `:end-of-input` represents Ctrl-D and follows
the usual delete-or-EOF behavior. `:stream-end` represents physical stream EOF;
handling it returns the `:end-of-input` action without clearing partial text.
`:insert-newline` adds an explicit newline without submitting the editor.
Arrow events return `:up` or `:down` so event-driven callers can invoke
`line-editor-move-vertical` with their current terminal width and prompt width,
falling back to explicit history events when it reports no adjacent visual row.
Pass `:history-match-function` to the constructor to filter those history
events. The function receives the complete draft captured when traversal begins
and each candidate entry. Down past the newest match restores that draft and
its original cursor; an empty draft always traverses every entry.

## Programmable keymaps

Clinedi decodes terminal input into semantic events, then resolves each event
through the editor's keymap. `default-line-editor-keymap` returns a fresh map
with the standard behavior, so an application can customize its own copy
without changing other editors:

```lisp
(defparameter *application-keymap*
  (clinedi:default-line-editor-keymap))

;; Give Up and Down unconditional history behavior.
(clinedi:keymap-bind *application-keymap* :up :history-previous)
(clinedi:keymap-bind *application-keymap* :down :history-next)

(clinedi:edit-line "> " :keymap *application-keymap*)
```

A binding maps an event to a built-in semantic command, a function, or a
non-keyword fbound symbol. Custom commands receive the editor and the original
event, and return the same action and optional payload pair as
`line-editor-handle-event`. They can call `line-editor-execute-command` to reuse
built-in behavior. `line-editor-command-for-event` exposes resolution separately
for event loops that need to inspect a command before executing it.

Keymaps support parent fallback. For a compound event such as
`(:insert "x")`, lookup checks that exact event, then `:insert`, before moving
to the parent. `keymap-unbind` removes a local binding and reveals its parent;
binding an event to `nil` masks the parent. `copy-keymap` copies every map and
binding table in the parent chain, while `keymap-bindings` returns a detached
snapshot of one map's local entries.

## Candidate selection

`clinedi:selector` is application-neutral navigation and viewport state for
pickers and interactive completions. Candidate values are opaque, so an
application can use strings for file completion, model records for a picker,
or any other values while retaining control of filtering, labels, styling and
acceptance policy. A selector can arrange candidates vertically or in a
row-major grid that measures candidate cell widths against the available
terminal width. Arrow keys navigate that geometry, Tab and Shift-Tab cycle
candidates forward and backward, Enter accepts, and ordinary editing input
dismisses the chooser while returning the selected value.

```lisp
(let ((selector (clinedi:make-selector
                 :items '("source/" "source/main.lisp")
                 :arrangement :grid)))
  (clinedi:selector-arrange selector 80
                           :width-function #'clinedi:text-cell-width)
  (clinedi:selector-handle-event selector :history-next)
  (clinedi:selector-selected-item selector))
```

## Blocking frontend

`clinedi:edit-line` owns key decoding and repainting while delegating terminal
raw mode, terminal size, completion, highlighting and suggestions to callbacks.
This keeps terminal policy and application semantics outside the library. The
terminal-size callback is refreshed while input is active, so wrapped text,
ghost suggestions and completion layouts follow terminal resizes without
losing the input cursor. Pass `:keymap` to customize command dispatch. Resolved
commands also control vertical movement, completion navigation and suggestion
acceptance, so remapped events behave consistently throughout the frontend.

Ambiguous completions open a live selector below the edited text. The default
`:completion-arrangement :grid` fits as many measured columns as the terminal
width permits and naturally collapses to a vertical list in narrow terminals.
Callers can request `:vertical` explicitly. Arrow keys navigate the displayed
geometry, Tab and Shift-Tab cycle forward and backward, Escape restores the
original prefix, and any other input keeps the selected candidate before
applying that input.

Enter submits input. Alt-Enter inserts a newline on terminals that encode Alt
as an Escape prefix. The blocking frontend temporarily enables CSI-u and
modifyOtherKeys reporting, so Shift-Enter, Ctrl-Enter, and Alt-Enter insert a
newline on terminals supporting either protocol. Event-driven applications can
balance `enable-keyboard-enhancement` with `disable-keyboard-enhancement` while
they own the terminal. Ctrl-Backspace and
Ctrl-W delete the whitespace and word before the cursor; Ctrl-Backspace works
with its raw control byte and its CSI-u or modifyOtherKeys encodings. Ctrl-Left
and Ctrl-Right move across words when the terminal emits the usual modified
arrow sequences. Up and Down move by physical display rows across explicit
newlines and terminal wrapping while preserving the preferred cell column;
only movement beyond the first or last visual row falls back to history. The
blocking frontend accepts the same optional `:history-match-function` as the
incremental editor.

## Live application region

Event-driven applications can keep editable or transient content below their
ordinary terminal output with `clinedi:live-region`. The region tracks its
physical rows and cursor position across wrapping and explicit newlines. It is
retracted before scrollback output, then repainted beneath that output without
entering an alternate screen or clearing earlier terminal contents. Compound
scrollback updates keep cursor motion hidden until the input cursor is back in
place.

Applications may call `live-region-set-cursor-visible` to keep cursor movement
hidden across repeated updates. Dismissing the region always restores cursor
visibility.

```lisp
(let ((region (clinedi:make-live-region :columns 80 :maximum-rows 20)))
  (clinedi:live-region-present region "> draft" :cursor 7)
  (clinedi:live-region-append region "tool completed\n")
  (clinedi:live-region-append-and-present
   region "partial output\n" "> revised draft" :cursor 15)
  (clinedi:live-region-resize region 120 :maximum-rows 30)
  (clinedi:live-region-dismiss region))
```

`live-region-present` accepts separate plain geometry text and trusted ANSI
display text when an application owns styling. Their visible contents must be
identical. `live-region-append` always leaves the cursor on a fresh line before
repainting the region, so appended output remains in normal scrollback.
`live-region-append-and-present` performs that append and a replacement repaint
in one terminal write and flush for streaming applications. An optional
`maximum-rows` keeps long multiline content inside a cursor-following viewport
while retaining the complete presentation for later repainting.
`live-region-resize` reconciles the painted rows with terminal reflow before
retracting them. Pass `:repaint-p nil` when the application will immediately
call `live-region-present`, allowing responsive content to replace the old
frame without an intermediate repaint.

Applications that manage their own presentation can use `clinedi:screen-window`
to obtain grapheme-safe start, end, and cursor indexes for the same bounded
multiline viewport behavior.
